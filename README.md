# APNA-COLLEGE-DSA-
# Java Practice Questions Repository
Welcome to my Java Practice Questions repository! Here, I store my solutions to various Java coding questions from the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course of Apna College. These questions help me strengthen my problem-solving skills and understanding of core concepts in Java.

üìò **About the Repository**
-This repository includes Java solutions to problems I‚Äôve practiced as part of the DSA course. My primary focus areas include:

-Data Structures: Arrays, ArrayList, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Stacks, Queues, Deque, 
-Algorithms: Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Greedy, Divide and Conquer, 
-Advanced Topics: Object-Oriented Programming and Java-specific optimizations
-Each solution file includes comments explaining the logic used, edge cases handled

‚úÖ **Questions Solved**
-Below are some topics covered along with example questions solved in each:

-Arrays: Finding duplicate elements, maximum subarray sum, etc.
-Linked Lists: Reversing a linked list, detecting cycles, etc.
-Trees: Binary search tree operations, tree traversal techniques, etc.
-Graphs: Depth-first search, finding shortest paths, etc.
Dynamic Programming: Solving knapsack problems, Fibonacci series, etc.
Check out individual folders for solutions grouped by topic or platform.
